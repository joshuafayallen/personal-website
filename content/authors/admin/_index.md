Welcome to my website! My name is Josh Allen and I am a third year PhD student
in the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/).
I earned my M.A. at Georgia State and am a proud [Sonoma State University alum](http://politicalscience.sonoma.edu/).

My research focuses on the impacts  of political violence and mass violence on political participation and attitudes in Western Europe. With interests on its effects for conflict dynamics and on its impact on contemporary politics.
