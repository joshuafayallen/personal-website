Welcome to my website! My name is Josh Allen and I am a third year PhD student
in the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/).
I earned my M.A. at Georgia State and am a proud [Sonoma State University alum](http://politicalscience.sonoma.edu/).

My research is currently focused on counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and technology in warfare.
However, I have broad interests in political violence and the legacies of political violence
