## Abstract

Are U.S. airstrikes effective at reducing insurgent violence? Airstrikes are an important tool in the U.S. counterterrorism strategy and have been used in Yemen since 2002 to kill planners of the U.S.S Cole Attack. However, the effectiveness of airstrikes is a contentious topic. I argue that Insurgent groups use violence after an airstrike as a costly signal to demonstrate cost tolerance and resolve to local actors. An insurgent groupsâ€™ reputation for resolve demonstrates that they are an important ally or their ability to offer violence as a selective incentive. Using the Armed Conflict Location and Event (ACLED) data from 2016 to 2018, I estimate a series of Auto distributive lag models. This study first assesses the effect of airstrikes and find that airstrikes are effective at increasing insurgent attacks. I then disaggregate my airstrike variable to examine the effects of militant causalities, leadership causalities, and civilian casualties.
